## **Priority Recommendations**

1. **Implement Least Privilege Access**  
   Restrict employee access to sensitive data based on their job roles and responsibilities. This will minimise potential damage caused by unauthorised access or a security breach.

2. **Develop and Enforce a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**  
   - Establish a detailed plan for responding to disasters such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and system failures.  
   - Ensure the DRP includes data backup and restoration procedures, recovery timelines, and communication protocols.  
   - Regularly test the DRP to ensure effectiveness.

3. **Adopt Encryption for Sensitive Data**  
   Encrypt customer credit card information and other sensitive data stored in internal databases to ensure confidentiality and protection from unauthorised access.

4. **Upgrade Password Management Policies and Tools**  
   - Implement a centralised password management system to enforce complexity requirements, such as:
     - Minimum length of 8 characters.
     - Inclusion of letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Require regular password updates and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems.

5. **Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
   Deploy an IDS to monitor network activity, detect suspicious behavior, and generate alerts for potential threats. This will enhance the organisation's ability to detect and respond to cyber threats in real time.

6. **Establish Regular Data Backups**  
   - Create a regular backup schedule for critical data, both onsite and offsite.  
   - Ensure backups are tested regularly to confirm data can be restored effectively when needed.

   - Implement encryption for credit card transaction data.  
   - Ensure all credit card data is stored and processed in secure environments.  
   - Adopt secure password management policies to comply with PCI DSS standards.

2. **Strengthen GDPR Adherence**  
   - Classify and inventory E.U. customersâ€™ data to ensure proper handling and privacy.  
   - Continue maintaining processes to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours in case of a breach.  
   - Enforce privacy policies and procedures to properly document and secure sensitive data.

3. **Improve SOC Type 1/2 Controls**  
   - Establish and enforce user access policies to ensure only authorised personnel can access sensitive data.  
   - Implement procedures to validate data integrity and ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

   Educate employees about cybersecurity best practices, including identifying phishing attempts, securing personal devices, and following internal security policies.

2. **Perform Ongoing Security Audits**  
   Schedule regular internal and external security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities as the organisation grows.
